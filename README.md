## About The Project

The objective of the MVP Project was to create any project with the minimum functionalities working. The goal is to create an application of choice within two days with the bare minimum functionality working. The project was done on creating a phone game similar to an aim helper. Only the front end side was implemented and no database was used due to the constraint of time. With more time some improvements could be: different targets, one ally and one enemy target. Implementing better logic for the targets to dissapear and have individual timers for each target. Implementing a scoreboard with a database for top scores. 

### Built With
